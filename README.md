# superagent-retry-delay

  Extends the node version of [superagent's](https://github.com/visionmedia/superagent) `Request`, adds a `.retry` method to add retrying logic to the request. Calling this will retry the request however many additional times you'd like after a specified delay in miliseconds.

  It will retry on any error condition, except for the list of response codes optionally supplied.

  v2 relies on superagent's internal retry mechanism for retrying, added on superagent 3.5. Use v1 otherwise.

  This library is based on [superagent-retry](https://github.com/segmentio/superagent-retry) and extends [superagent](https://github.com/visionmedia/superagent)

## Usage

```javascript
// With superagent
const superagent = require('superagent');
require('superagent-retry-delay')(superagent);

superagent
  .get('https://segment.io')
  .retry(2, 5000, [401, 404]) // retry twice before responding, wait 5 seconds between failures, DO NOT retry when response is success. RETRY when response is or 401 or 404
  .end(onresponse);

superagent
  .get('https://segment.io')
  .retry(3, [1000, 3000, 10000], [401, 404]) // retry three times before responding, first wait 1 second, then 3 seconds, and finally 10 seconds between failures, DO NOT retry when response is success. RETRY when response is 401 or 404
  .end(onresponse);

superagent
  .get('https://segment.io')
  .retry(5, [1000, 3000], [502, 503]) // retry five times before responding, first wait 1 second, and then wait 3 seconds between all other failures, DO NOT retry when response is success. RETRY when response is 502 or 503
  .end(onresponse);

function onresponse (err, res) {
  console.log(res.status, res.headers);
  console.log(res.body);
}

```

```javascript
// With supertest
const superagent = require('superagent');
require('superagent-retry-delay')(superagent);

const supertest = require('supertest');
```

## Mocha users

  Ensure your mocha timeout for tests (default is 2000ms) is long enough to accommodate for all possible retries, including the specified delays.

## Retrying Cases

  Currently the retrying logic ONLY checks for errors in the provided list of status codes.
